<b>Steampunk, Principle DevSecOps Engineer</b> -  08/2024-Present<br/>
On contract for FEMA<br/>
Development Environment: Google Cloud Platform, Gitlab, Harness, Openshift (Kubernetes), ArgoCD, NexusRM, Jenkins, MySQL<br/>
<br/>
Brought in as a DevOps engineer, Thomas quickly learned the Google Cloud Platform and Openshift environment. He was
assigned as a DevOps Liason for application development and then learned their particular applications as well. He was
fundamental in assisting the team toward successfully meeting their goals.<br/>
<br/>
Notably:
<ul>
<li>Reviewed, updated, and standardized his development teams Openshift configuration files while rewriting them
from Kustomize to Helm Templates. This allowed for greater readability, easier configuration and freeing of
unneeded resources. This was also an required step in the move from releasing via Jenkins to via Harness.
<li>Lead and updated the Jenkins release process. This release process involved running all customizations required
and updating the applications on load night, debugging any issues that may occur and releasing the environment to
the testing teams and getting approval to release the environment to the customers.
<li>Address several security concerns including:
◦ Changes to ensure Gitlab branches were tied to an appropriate Jira ticket
◦ Updating pipelines to invoke DAST scans (Invicti) during builds
◦ Investigating and addressing MySQL security audit concerns
</ul>

<b>Steampunk, Senior DevOps Engineer → Technical Lead → Principle DevSecOps Engineer</b> - 08/2021-01/2024<br/>
On contract for USPTO<br/>
Development Environment: AWS (Hybrid), GitLab, Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus RM3, Nexus IQ<br/>
<br/>
Originally brought in as a Senior DevOps Engineer, Thomas was quickly promoted to  lead of the Platform team. This small team (2-4 individuals) was responsible for installation, upgrades and maintenance of the Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) applications used by the customer.  These applications included:<br/>
<ul>
<li> Gitlab (for both git repository and CI/CD via Gitlab Runners)
<li> (CloudBees) Jenkins and Jenkins Community Edition
<li> SonarQube (for Static Code Analysis)
<li> Sonatype Nexus IQ ( for Dependency Analysis, Static Code Analysis and SBOM creation)
<li> Sonatype Nexus Respository Manager (for jars, npm and docker images)
</ul>
<br/>
This team proposed, created, and executed and upgrade cadence for these applications.  They wrote Terraform and Ansible scripts to automate installation processes, provide an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) traceability and blue/green deployments. This allowed the team to significantly decrease the amount of time needed to upgrade applications from months to hours, with one case involving a critical patch being upgrading from start to finish within 18 hours.<br/>
<br/>
The team also supported a move from CloudBees Jenkins (on premises) to Jenkins Community Edition running on containers using AWS Fargate. This saved the client significant amounts on licensing fees and on a reduced on-premises server footprint.<br/>
<br/>
The Platform team also proposed and outlined migration plans to move Nexus IQ and Nexus RM from the on premises data center to AWS.<br/>
<br/>
Thomas was promoted to Technical Lead, assisting both the Platform team and the Pipeline team.  The Pipeline team was a small team of 2-4 developers that were responsible for the development, advocacy and maintenance of the pipeline tools used by all development teams of the client.  Specifically, this team was responsible for researching, evaluating, and developing pipelines to compile, analyze and deploy development teams code in both Gitlab and Jenkins.  Furthermore, they provided Proof-of-Concepts and supported pipelines to other applications such as LoadRunner, Fortify, and WebInspect.<br/>
<br/>
In 2023, Thomas was promoted to Principle DevSecOps Engineer.<br/>
