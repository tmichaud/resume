<b>Steampunk, Principle DevSecOps Engineer 08/2024-Present</b><br/>
<b>On contract for FEMA</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development Environment: Google Cloud Platform, GitLab, Harness, OpenShift (Kubernetes), Helm, ArgoCD,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NexusRM, Jenkins, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, HashiCorp Vault<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought in as a Senior DevOps engineer, Thomas quickly learned the Google Cloud Platform and OpenShift environment. He was assigned as a DevOps Liaison for the Phoenix application development team. He learned their particular applications and was fundamental in assisting the team in configuration changes and increasing their release velocity.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notably:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-   Updated Application Harness pipelines to utilize the External Secrets Operator to allow for credentials to be stored in HashiCorp Vault.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-   Reviewed, updated, and standardized his development team's OpenShift configuration files while rewriting them from Kustomize to Helm Templates. This allowed for greater readability, easier configuration and the freeing of unneeded resources. This was also an required step in the move from releasing via Jenkins to via Harness.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-   Lead and updated the Jenkins release process. This release process involved running all customizations required and updating the applications on load night, debugging any issues that may occur and releasing the environment to the testing teams and getting approval to release the environment to the customers.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-   Addressed several security concerns including:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    -   Changes to ensure GitLab branches were tied to an appropriate Jira ticket<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    -   Updating pipelines to invoke DAST scans (Invicti) during builds<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    -   Investigating and addressing MySQL security audit concerns<br/>

<b>Steampunk, Senior DevOps Engineer → Technical Lead → Principle DevSecOps Engineer 08/2021-01/2024</b><br/>
<b>On contract for USPTO</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development Environment: AWS (Hybrid), GitLab, Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus RM, Nexus IQ<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally brought in as a Senior DevOps Engineer, Thomas was quickly promoted to lead of the Platform team. This small team (2-4 individuals) was responsible for installation, upgrades and maintenance of the Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) applications used by the customer. These applications included:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-   GitLab (both for git repository and CI/CD via GitLab Runners)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-   (CloudBees) Jenkins and Jenkins Community Edition<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-   SonarQube (for Static Code Analysis)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-   Sonatype Nexus IQ (for Dependency Analysis, Static Code Analysis and SBOM creation)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-   Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager (for jars, npms, and docker images)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This team proposed, created, and executed an upgrade cadence for these applications. They wrote Terraform and Ansible scripts to automate installation processes to provide Infrastructure as Code (IaC) traceability and blue/green deployments. This allowed the team to significantly decrease the amount of time needed to upgrade applications.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team also supported a move from CloudBees Jenkins (on premises) to Jenkins Community Edition running in containers using AWS Fargate. This saved the client significant amounts on licensing fees and on a reduced on-premises server footprint.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Platform team also proposed and outlined migration plans to move Nexus IQ and Nexus RM from the on premises data center to AWS.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas was promoted to Technical Lead, assisting both the Platform team and the Pipeline team. The Pipeline team was a small team of 2-4 developers that were responsible for the development, advocacy and maintenance of the pipeline tools used by all development teams of the client. Specifically, this team was responsible for researching, evaluating, and developing pipelines to compile, analyze and deploy development teams code in both GitLab and Jenkins. Furthermore, they provided Proof-of-Concepts and supported pipelines to other applications such as LoadRunner, Fortify, and WebInspect.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2023, Thomas was promoted to Principle DevSecOps Engineer.<br/>
