<b>Accesso, Team Lead – Payments</b> - 12/2014-03/2016</div><br/> 
Development Environment:	Java, MySQL, C#, XML, Sockets
<br/>
Implemented new payment processing solutions while maintaining and monitoring the single back-end e-commerce solution for web, kiosk and mobile platforms Point-of-Sale platforms.
