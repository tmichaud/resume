**Steampunk, Principle DevSecOps Engineer 08/2024-Present**

**On contract for FEMA**

Development Environment: Google Cloud Platform, GitLab, Harness,
OpenShift (Kubernetes), Helm, ArgoCD,

NexusRM, Jenkins, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, HashiCorp Vault

Brought in as a Senior DevOps engineer, Thomas quickly learned the
Google Cloud Platform and OpenShift environment. He was assigned as a
DevOps Liaison for the Phoenix application development team. He learned
their particular applications and was fundamental in assisting the team
in configuration changes and increasing their release velocity.

Notably:

-   Updated Application Harness pipelines to utilize the External
    Secrets Operator to allow for credentials to be stored in HashiCorp
    Vault.

-   Reviewed, updated, and standardized his development team's OpenShift
    configuration files while rewriting them from Kustomize to Helm
    Templates. This allowed for greater readability, easier
    configuration and the freeing of unneeded resources. This was also
    an required step in the move from releasing via Jenkins to via
    Harness.

-   Lead and updated the Jenkins release process. This release process
    involved running all customizations required and updating the
    applications on load night, debugging any issues that may occur and
    releasing the environment to the testing teams and getting approval
    to release the environment to the customers.

-   Addressed several security concerns including:

    -   Changes to ensure GitLab branches were tied to an appropriate
        Jira ticket

    -   Updating pipelines to invoke DAST scans (Invicti) during builds

    -   Investigating and addressing MySQL security audit concerns

**Steampunk, Senior DevOps Engineer → Technical Lead → Principle
DevSecOps Engineer 08/2021-01/2024**

**On contract for USPTO**

Development Environment: AWS (Hybrid), GitLab, Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus
RM, Nexus IQ

Originally brought in as a Senior DevOps Engineer, Thomas was quickly
promoted to lead of the Platform team. This small team (2-4 individuals)
was responsible for installation, upgrades and maintenance of the
Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) applications used by the customer. These
applications included:

> \- GitLab (both for git repository and CI/CD via GitLab Runners)
>
> \- (CloudBees) Jenkins and Jenkins Community Edition
>
> \- SonarQube (for Static Code Analysis)
>
> \- Sonatype Nexus IQ (for Dependency Analysis, Static Code Analysis
> and SBOM creation)
>
> \- Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager (for jars, npms, and docker
> images)

This team proposed, created, and executed an upgrade cadence for these
applications. They wrote Terraform and Ansible scripts to automate
installation processes to provide Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
traceability and blue/green deployments. This allowed the team to
significantly decrease the amount of time needed to upgrade
applications.

The team also supported a move from CloudBees Jenkins (on premises) to
Jenkins Community Edition running in containers using AWS Fargate. This
saved the client significant amounts on licensing fees and on a reduced
on-premises server footprint.

The Platform team also proposed and outlined migration plans to move
Nexus IQ and Nexus RM from the on premises data center to AWS.

Thomas was promoted to Technical Lead, assisting both the Platform team
and the Pipeline team. The Pipeline team was a small team of 2-4
developers that were responsible for the development, advocacy and
maintenance of the pipeline tools used by all development teams of the
client. Specifically, this team was responsible for researching,
evaluating, and developing pipelines to compile, analyze and deploy
development teams code in both GitLab and Jenkins. Furthermore, they
provided Proof-of-Concepts and supported pipelines to other applications
such as LoadRunner, Fortify, and WebInspect.

In 2023, Thomas was promoted to Principle DevSecOps Engineer.
